# "IoT Core Media Player"

We'll create a UWP app to demonstrate how to play media files such as music from an IoT device.

## Load the project in Visual Studio

You can find the source code for this sample by downloading a zip of all of our samples [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-iotcore-samples/archive/master.zip) and navigating to the `samples-develop\AppServiceBlinky`.  Make a copy of the folder on your disk and open the projects from Visual Studio.  BlinkyService.sln implements the app service and must be started first.  BlinkyClient.sln implements the app service client.

Navigate to the IotCoreMediaPlayer project and open the project from Visual Studio.

## IoT Core Media Player contents

The IoT Core Media Player solution contains the Universal Windows Application project that displays a graphical user interface for finding and opening media files on the device.

Right-click on **IotCoreMediaPlayer** project and select **'Set as StartUp Project'** from the pop up menu displayed.

When everything is set up, you should be able to press F5 from Visual Studio.  The IoT Core Media Player app will deploy and start on the Windows IoT device.
