# Introduction 
Machine Learning sample for node-ChakraCore running sentiment prediction using Natural.

# Getting Started
Download [node-ChakraCore release binaries](https://github.com/nodejs/node-chakracore/releases) from the github or use [NVS](https://github.com/jasongin/nvs) to install the node-ChakraCore runtime. NVS makes it easy to switch between versions like release or daily build.  
Update PATH environment variable to include the path to the node-ChakraCore binaries.  NVS does this path update on selection of which version to use.

Install the sample package  
  * npm install &lt;path to package&gt;  

Sentiment prediction using Natural  
  * change to the sample directory  
  * node NaturalDemo.js  
  * Model data is stored in classifierData.json  
  * As the model get more data to train with, the predictions should get better.  

# Build and Test
The dependencies should be binary drop instead of compile/build packages.  Might need VS if some of the package installs need to build.
